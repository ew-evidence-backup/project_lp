                    <h2>Sell Traffic</h2>

                    <p class="intro">By working as a publisher you can sell traffic directly to a large network of advertisers. By adding your website, you can easily create one or more adzones and start generating income. There are several ways to sell your traffic and below is a quick introduction to the options we have available for you</p>

                    <br>

                    <h2 class="legend"><div><span>Our Traffic</span></div></h2>

                    <p class="intro">We offer several ways for advertisers to promote their products. Below is a short introduction to the types of traffic we offer</p>
                    <br>

                    <div class="pane-blue mobile-pops-traffic">

                        <h3><span>Mobile Pops Traffic (Clicked)</span></h3>

                        <p class="intro">Mobile Pops Traffic will give you highly targeted clicked traffic from Mobile Devices. It will be delivered to you via ads displayed in widgets throughout our network. You need to create ads either before creating your campaign or while creating it. Each campaign needs minium one ad, but we recommend to have at least three</p>

                            <a href="#" class="btn btn-blue">create ads</a>

                        <h3><span>Pop Under Traffic</span></h3>

                        <p class="intro">Popunder Traffic can give you lots of visitors in a short amount of time. When a visitor is visiting a website in our network, we can open a browser window behind the website the visitor is visiting. In that window we will open your website. This traffic is much cheaper than clicked traffic and is working very well for many advertisers.</p>
